Jacob
  - Passive healing
  - Separate L/R cooldowns
  - Optional spell steal (I have an idea for what this could look like)
  - Enemy health meters (above head)
  - Boss health meter (bottom of screen)
  - Enemy pathing 
    - avoid just kiting  
    - maybe they stop moving once in spell range
    - maybe add some randomness to movement

Eric
  - Need sound - big deal
  - Looks nice
