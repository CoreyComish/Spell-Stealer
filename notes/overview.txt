Level 5 - Boss (Hub World)
  
  Spells:
    No new spells    

  Enemy:
    Plasma/Dark/Stalagmite Golem: All in Game
  
  Description:
    After completing levels 1-4, a new object appears in the hub world. When the player interacts with that object, the final boss spawns. The doors/portals to the other levels now act as spawn points for enemies from that level. I'm thinking every 25% health from the main boss, he goes into "block mode", and spawns enemies, and we can't damage main boss until all enemies are defeated. Maybe for the last 25% he spawns the 4 golems from the other levels. We can also alter which spells the main boss is able to use depending on which 25% we're in. Maybe "weaker" spells at the beginning, and "stronger" spells at the end.
